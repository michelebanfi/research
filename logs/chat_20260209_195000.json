Use this for questions about specific code, concepts, facts, or technical details.\n2. graph_search(concepts (comma-separated string): Concept names to search for and find connections)\n   - Search the knowledge graph for concept connections and relationships. Use this to find how concepts are related or to explore the structure of the knowledge.\n3. project_summary(None required)\n   - Get a high-level overview of all files and their summaries in the project. Use this for broad questions like 'What is this project about?' or 'Give me an overview'.\n4. python_interpreter(code (string): Python code to execute)\n   - Execute Python code and return the output. Use this to run computations, process data, or verify results. The code runs in an isolated environment with common libraries available (json, math, re, collections, itertools).\n5. web_search(query (string): The search query)\n   - Search the web for fresh information, documentation, or topics not in the local knowledge base. Use when local search returns no or low-relevance results.\n\nTO USE A TOOL:\nACTION: tool_name(your query here)\n\nTO GIVE FINAL ANSWER:\nFINAL ANSWER: your complete answer here\n\nEXAMPLE:\nUser: What is machine learning?\nACTION: vector_search(machine learning definition)\n\nUser: What is this project about?\nACTION: project_summary()\n\nALWAYS start by calling a tool. Write ACTION: now.\n\nUSER QUERY: What these files talk about?\n\nThink step by step. What tool(s) do you need to answer this question?",
