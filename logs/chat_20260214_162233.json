All codes have weight-6 checks, thickness-2 Tanner graph, and a depth-7 syndrome measurement circuit. Code distance was computed by the mixed integer programming approach of ref. 68. The notation \u2264 d indicates that only an upper bound on the code distance is known at the time of this writing. We round r down to the nearest inverse integer. The codes have check matrices H X = ( A \u2223 B ) and H Z = ( B T \u2223 A T ) with A and B define\n---\n[Source 3] (relevance: 0.13)\nFile: static/uploads/High-threshold and low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memory.pdf\nContent: The simulation software to generate data reported in this paper is available at https://github.com/sbravyi/BivariateBicycleCodes/.\n\n59.

      "response": "Based on the information provided in your knowledge base, **decode methods for Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes** can be inferred from the citation in [Source 1] and [Source 2]. Both mention that example implementations of BBB codes have been studied, and these typically use **syndrome measurement circuits** for detecting and correcting errors. \n\nSpecifically:\n- The first source highlights that small examples of BBB codes feature check matrices **H X = (A\u2223B)** and **H Z = (B T \u2223 A T)**.\n- Decoding in BBB codes involves using syndrome measurement, which combines a Tanner graph-based error identification and correction. \n\nThus, **syndrome measurement techniques**\u2014analyzed or utilized in the construction or analysis of these codes\u2014are likely the main decoding method, as detailed in [Source 1] and [Source 2].\n\nAdditionally, it's emphasized that the reconstruction and error-correction aspects of BBB codes are probed using Lasserre networks or similar algorithms, as identified in [Source 3].\n\n**In summary:** For BBB codes, commonly employed decoding methods include syndrome measurement, utilizing the error correction strategies described, and error-detection processes outlined in their theoretical underpinnings."
