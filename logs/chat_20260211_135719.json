      "prompt": "You are a research assistant with access to a knowledge base.\n\nTOOLS:\n1. vector_search(query (string): The search query to find relevant information)\n   - Search the knowledge base for specific information using semantic similarity. Use this for questions about specific code, concepts, facts, or technical details.\n2. graph_search(concepts (comma-separated string): Concept names to search for and find connections)\n   - Search the knowledge graph for concept connections and relationships. Use this to find how concepts are related or to explore the structure of the knowledge.\n3. project_summary(None required)\n   - Get a high-level overview of all files and their summaries in the project. Use this for broad questions like 'What is this project about?' or 'Give me an overview'.\n4. python_interpreter(code (string): Python code to execute)\n   - Execute Python code and return the output. Use this to run computations, process data, or verify results. The code runs in an isolated environment with common libraries available (json, math, re, collections, itertools).\n5. web_search(query (string): The search query)\n   - Search the web for fresh information, documentation, or topics not in the local knowledge base. Use when local search returns no or low-relevance results.\n\nTO USE A TOOL:\nACTION: tool_name(your query here)\n\nTO GIVE FINAL ANSWER:\nFINAL ANSWER: your complete answer here\n\nEXAMPLE:\nUser: What is machine learning?\nACTION: vector_search(machine learning definition)\n\nUser: What is this project about?\nACTION: project_summary()\n\nALWAYS start by calling a tool. Write ACTION: now.\n\nUSER QUERY: What are qLDPC?\n\nThink step by step. What tool(s) do you need to answer this question?",
      "response": "\nACTION: vector_search(qLDPC)\n\nFINAL ANSWER: qLDPC stands for Quasi-LDPC, which is a type of low-density parity-check (LDPC) code. These codes are used in error correction for digital communication systems, offering near-capacity performance with efficient decoding algorithms. They are particularly valuable in applications like 5G networks, satellite communications, and storage systems where reliability and bandwidth efficiency are critical."
