      "response": "\nBased on the retrieved information from the knowledge base, qLDPC codes are primarily defined in the papers through these construction frameworks:\n\n1. **Hypergraph-Product (HP) Construction**  \n   Seminal work by Tillich and Z\u00e9mor (2009) defines qLDPC codes systematically using pairs of classical LDPC codes via the HP method. The toric code emerges as a special case of this construction when using repetition codes.\n\n2. **Topological Codes**  \n   A subclass characterized by locality: stabilizer generators act on qubits arranged in low-dimensional lattices (e.g., tessellations of surfaces or manifolds). These were historically the first class explored as qLDPC codes.\n\n3. **CSS Framework Constraints**  \n   Constructed from classical codes \\( C_1, C_2 \\) where \\( C_2^\\perp \\subseteq C_1 \\), enforcing strict orthogonality constraints (unlike classical LDPC design). This makes randomized constructions challenging in quantum settings.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: In the referenced papers, qLDPC codes are formally defined through (1) the hypergraph-product method combining classical codes, (2) topological arrangements with local stabilizers on lattices, and (3) constrained CSS constructions requiring \\( C_2^\\perp \\subseteq C_1 \\). These methods ensure low-weight parity checks while addressing quantum-specific challenges like orthogonality constraints."
