Use this for questions about specific code, concepts, facts, or technical details.\n2. graph_search(concepts (comma-separated string): Concept names to search for and find connections)\n   - Search the knowledge graph for concept connections and relationships. Use this to find how concepts are related or to explore the structure of the knowledge.\n3. project_summary(None required)\n   - Get a high-level overview of all files and their summaries in the project. Use this for broad questions like 'What is this project about?' or 'Give me an overview'.\n4. python_interpreter(code (string): Python code to execute)\n   - Execute Python code and return the output. Use this to run computations, process data, or verify results. The code runs in an isolated environment with common libraries available (json, math, re, collections, itertools).\n5. web_search(query (string): The search query)\n   - Search the web for fresh information, documentation, or topics not in the local knowledge base. Use when local search returns no or low-relevance results.\n\nFORMAT:\nYou must respond in JSON format with a \"thought\" field and either an \"action\" or \"final_answer\" field.\n\nRESPONSE EXAMPLES:\n\n1. To call a tool:\n{\n  \"thought\": \"I need to search for machine learning definitions.\",\n  \"action\": {\n    \"tool_name\": \"vector_search\",\n    \"argument\": \"machine learning definition\"\n  }\n}\n\n2. To give a final answer:\n{\n  \"thought\": \"I have found enough information to answer the user.\",\n  \"final_answer\": \"Machine learning is a field of study...\"\n}\n\nGUIDELINES:\n1. Always include a \"thought\" field to explain your reasoning step-by-step.\n2. Only use valid JSON.\n3. Choose the most relevant tool for the task.\n4. When you have sufficient information, provide a \"final_answer\".\n\n\nUSER QUERY:...",
