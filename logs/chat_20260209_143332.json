They showed that the well-known toric code appears as a special case of their construction, corresponding to the HP product...",
      "response": "The vector search results indicate that QLDPC codes are constructed using the hypergraph-product method, which systematically creates codes from classical LDPC codes. The history of their design includes topological codes and asymptotic constructions, highlighting their significance in modern coding theory. However, the provided information does not specify further research directions or applications beyond this. To summarize, the next steps would involve exploring how these codes are applied in practical systems or further advancements in their design. \n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe next steps in researching QLDPC codes involve exploring their applications in practical systems or further advancements in their design, as the provided information focuses on their construction and historical context."
