      "response": "FINAL ANSWER: QLDPC codes are a subclass of QLDPC family characterized by stabilizer generators that act locally on qubits arranged in a low-dimensional lattice. They were initially investigated as topological codes and can be systematically constructed from any pair of classical LDPC codes using the hypergraph-product (HP) method. Designing QLDPC codes is more challenging than classical LDPC codes due to the orthogonality constraint imposed by the CSS construction."
