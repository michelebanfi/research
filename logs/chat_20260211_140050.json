      "response": "Based on the search results, I have good information about qLDPC codes. Let me provide a comprehensive answer:\n\nFINAL ANSWER: qLDPC (Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check) codes are quantum error-correcting codes that extend the concept of classical LDPC codes to the quantum domain. Here are the key aspects:\n\n**Definition and Basic Properties:**\n- qLDPC codes form a family of quantum codes characterized by stabilizer generators that act locally on qubits arranged in a low-dimensional lattice structure\n- They include topological codes as a subclass, where the qubits are arranged as tessellations of surfaces or higher-dimensional manifolds\n\n**Construction Methods:**\n- A systematic construction method was developed in 2009 by Tillich and Z\u00e9mor using the hypergraph-product (HP) method\n- This method constructs quantum LDPC codes from any pair of classical LDPC codes\n- The well-known toric code appears as a special case of this construction, corresponding to the HP product of two classical repetition codes\n- When using asymptotically good classical LDPC codes (with constant rate and linear minimum distance), this construction yields important quantum codes\n\n**Design Challenges:**\n- Designing qLDPC codes is significantly more challenging than classical LDPC codes\n- This difficulty primarily stems from the orthogonality constraint imposed by the CSS (Calderbank-Shor-Steane) construction\n- Unlike classical LDPC codes where Tanner graphs can be freely manipulated, the quantum case has additional constraints\n\n**Families and Applications:**\n- Various families of qLDPC codes exist, with some being less commonly used in practice but offering important theoretical insights\n- Some constructions achieve strong asymptotic parameters\n- The field has evolved from topological codes to more sophisticated asymptotically good constructions\n\nqLDPC codes represent an important area of quantum error correction research, aiming to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation with practical resource r..."
