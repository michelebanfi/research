Use this for questions about specific code, concepts, facts, or technical details.\n2. graph_search(concepts (comma-separated string): Concept names to search for and find connections)\n   - Search the knowledge graph for concept connections and relationships. Use this to find how concepts are related or to explore the structure of the knowledge.\n3. project_summary(None required)\n   - Get a high-level overview of all files and their summaries in the project. Use this for broad questions like 'What is this project about?' or 'Give me an overview'.\n4. python_interpreter(code (string): Python code to execute)\n   - Execute Python code and return the output. Use this to run computations, process data, or verify results. The code runs in an isolated environment with common libraries available (json, math, re, collections, itertools).\n\nTO USE A TOOL:\nACTION: tool_name(your query here)\n\nTO GIVE FINAL ANSWER:\nFINAL ANSWER: your complete answer here\n\nEXAMPLE:\nUser: What is machine learning?\nACTION: vector_search(machine learning definition)\n\nUser: What is this project about?\nACTION: project_summary()\n\nALWAYS start by calling a tool.

      "response": "ACTION: vector_search(degeneracy definition)  \n\n**Explanation:**  \nDegeneracy refers to a situation where a variable or function does not have a default value, or it is explicitly set to a specific value. This can occur in programming, mathematics, or other fields. For example:  \n- In programming, a function without a default parameter may be called with a specific value, making it non-degenerate.  \n- In mathematics, a degenerate set is a shape that is collapsed into a lower dimension (e.g., a line instead of a plane).  \n\n**Final Answer:**  \nDegeneracy describes a state where a variable or function has a fixed value, or is set explicitly, leading to simplification. For example, in programming, a function without a default parameter may be called with a specific value, making it non-degenerate. In mathematics, a degenerate set is a shape that is collapsed into a lower dimension. The exact meaning can vary depending on the context."
