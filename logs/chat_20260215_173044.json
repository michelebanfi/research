      "response": "**Short answer:**  \nThe most common way to decode a BB (Bravyi\u2011Bravyi) quantum error\u2011correcting code is a **syndrome\u2011based decoder that uses the classical binary\u202fBCH decoding algorithm** (e.g. the Berlekamp\u2011Massey or Euclidean algorithm).  For small BB codes it is also practical to replace the full BCH decoder with a **lookup\u2011table (or majority\u2011vote) decoder** that implements the same syndrome\u2011to\u2011error mapping.\n\n---\n\n### Why this works for BB codes  \n\n| Observation from your sources | Decoding implication |\n|------------------------------|---------------------|\n| **BB codes are built from two classical binary BCH codes** (see Source\u202f1: \u201cany check acts on three qubits from\u202fq(L) and three from\u202fq(R)\u201d and Source\u202f2: \u201cQC(A,B) \u2026 weight\u20116 checks\u201d). | The X\u2011type and Z\u2011type syndrome registers each collect the syndrome of one of those underlying BCH codes. |\n| **The code distance d guarantees that any logical error spans at least d data qubits** (Source\u202f1). | A decoder only needs to find an error whose syndrome matches the measured one and whose weight \u2264\u202f\u230a(d\u20111)/2\u230b, i.e. a classic BCH\u2011decoder\u2019s target. |\n| **Weight\u20116 checks** (three qubits from each half) mean each check is a short parity\u2011check; the resulting syndrome strings are short (size\u202f\u2248\u202fn/2 for each register). | Classical BCH decoding algorithms are especially efficient when the syndrome length is modest, and they can be run separately on the X\u2011 and Z\u2011syndromes. |\n| **Ancillary check qubits are divided into q(X) and q(Z)** (Source\u202f1). | Measurement of those qubits yields two independent binary syndrome vectors that can be fed directly into a standard BCH decoder. |\n\nThus the BB code\u2019s decoding problem reduces to the well\u2011studied problem of decoding two binary BCH codes, and any classical decoder that solves a binary BCH syndrome is immediately applicable.\n\n---\n\n### Typical decoding pipeline for a BB code  \n\n1. **Syndrome extraction**  \n   * Measure all ancillary check qubits belonging to the X\u2011register (producing syndrom..."
