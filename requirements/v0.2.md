| **DB-06** | Database | **Graph Schema Definition** | Extend `schema.sql` to include `nodes` (Entities) and `edges` (Relationships) tables, replacing or augmenting the flat `keywords` table to support Subject-Predicate-Object triples. | **High** |
| **AI-05** | AI Processing | **Relationship Extraction** | Implement a new prompt strategy in `AIEngine` to extract structured triples (e.g., `Paper A -> CITES -> Paper B`, `Author X -> WROTE -> Paper A`) instead of simple flat keywords. | **High** |
| **DB-07** | Database | **Recursive Graph Traversal** | Create a SQL function using `WITH RECURSIVE` to enable multi-hop queries (e.g., finding "cousin" papers that share citations or authors) directly within Supabase. | **High** |
| **AI-06** | AI Processing | **Hybrid Search Strategy** | Update the search interface to combine Vector Similarity (finding related concepts) with Graph Traversal (finding related entities) for richer research context. | **Medium** |
| **UI-03** | User Interface | **Graph Visualization** | Add a visualization component in the "Knowledge Explorer" tab to render the local neighborhood of a selected paper (nodes and edges) using a library like `streamlit-agraph`. | **Low** |
